# StackC
Stack in C

Big issue: Only works for integers, To make the stack work for other types, you'll need to 
    change code.

stack_create_int() takes a size, returns a ptr
stack_push_int() takes a ptr and value, pushes value to the top of stack
stack_get_int() gets value from top of stack
stack_pop_int() removes value from top of stack
stack_delete_int() deletes stack
